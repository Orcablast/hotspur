            <p>
              One of our own, Harry Kane has risen from our Academy to establish
              himself as one of the best strikers around. The striker scored 17
              goals in 28 Premier League appearances during 2018/19, despite two
              separate ankle injuries in early 2019. One of those occurred in
              the first leg of our Champions League quarter-final epic against
              Manchester City at the new stadium in April, 2019, but he returned
              in time to start the final against Liverpool in Madrid in June. In
              all, Harry scored 24 goals in 40 appearances during that season.
              In November, 2019, he scored twice in a 4-2 home win over
              Olympiacos in the Champions League, becoming the quickest player
              to reach the 20-goal mark in the competition's history, a record
              previously held by Alessandro Del Piero. Born in Walthamstow,
              Harry joined our Academy in July, 2009, and signed professional
              forms a year later. He joined Leyton Orient on loan in January,
              2011, where he made his Football League debut and scored five
              goals in 18 games. The following season, 2011/12, saw his initial
              emergence at Spurs with a debut against Hearts and six appearances
              in the Europa League, including his first goal in a victory at
              Shamrock Rovers. He then joined Millwall on loan in January, 2012,
              and scored nine goals in 27 games for the Lions. He made his
              Premier League debut for us on the opening day of 2012/13, taking
              his tally to eight appearances, before joining Norwich City on
              loan, but a serious ankle injury restricted him to four games at
              Carrow Road. On his return to fitness, Harry joined Leicester City
              and helped them reach the Championship play-offs, where they lost
              over two legs to Watford. He made 13 appearances for the Foxes,
              scoring twice. Harry was back in the fold for us in 2013/14 and
              made 19 appearances in all competitions. He was handed his first
              Premier League start in our colours against Sunderland in April,
              2014, and responded with a first top flight goal - the first of
              three in as many games. It was in 2014/15, however, that he really
              shot to fame. In the opening months of the season, Harry had
              scored eight goals in cup competitions including his first senior
              hat-trick against Asteras Tripolis - a game that also saw him have
              a brief stint in goal - before grabbing his first Premier League
              goal of the season in the form of a last-minute free-kick to take
              maximum points at Aston Villa on November 2, 2014. That earned him
              a first Spurs start in the Premier League against Stoke City on
              November 9, and he didn't look back, going on to score 31 goals in
              51 appearances in all competitions, thus becoming the first Spur
              to break the 30-goal barrier since Gary Lineker in 1991/92. He hit
              21 goals in 34 Premier League outings - matching the totals of
              Gareth Bale (2012-13) and Teddy Sheringham (1992/93) - and became
              the first home-grown player to bag 20 league goals in a season
              since Mark Falco in 1984/85. There were some magic moments along
              the way, too. He grabbed two goals in our spectacular 5-3 home win
              over eventual champions Chelsea on New Year's Day - the second
              goal voted Goal of the Month on Match of the Day - and topped that
              with both goals in a 2-1 home win against Arsenal in February,
              2015, in what was his first start in the North London derby. He
              won back-to-back Premier League Player of the Month awards in
              January and February and followed that up with his first Premier
              League hat-trick against Leicester City in March, 2015. A few days
              later, he marked his first senior England cap with a goal just 79
              seconds after coming off the bench! His close-range header against
              Lithuania saw him score the third-fastest goal ever by an England
              debutant - a record still held by the great Bill Nicholson - and
              he went on to earn his first senior start for the Three Lions in
              Italy soon afterwards. As a result of his tremendous campaign, he
              earned the PFA Young Player of the Year award and a place in the
              PFA Premier League Team of the Year, also sweeping the board in
              terms of our club awards by being crowned Supporters' Clubs', One
              Hotspur Members' and One Hotspur Juniors' Player of the Year.
              After a slow start to the 2015/16 campaign, he got off the mark in
              a 4-1 home win over Manchester City in September, 2015, and went
              on to net 28 goals in 50 appearances in all competitions including
              a league-best 25 strikes on the domestic scene. In doing so, he
              became only the second Spur behind Teddy Sheringham in 1992/93 to
              win the Premier League’s Golden Boot and set a new Club record for
              goals in a Premier League season. He was also named Premier League
              Player of the Month for March, 2016, and earned a spot in the PFA
              Premier League Team of the Year. Harry picked up a second
              consecutive Premier League Golden Boot in 2016/17 with 29 league
              goals from 30 top flight appearances, in spite of missing a
              combined total of 11 weeks of the season after picking up ankle
              injuries against Sunderland in September, 2016, and Millwall in
              the FA Cup in March, 2017. He scored 35 goals in 38 games in all
              competitions and completed his haul with a first ever four-goal
              salvo in our 6-1 win at Leicester City on the penultimate matchday
              of the season, before netting his fifth hat-trick of the campaign
              in a 7-1 triumph at Hull City on the final day. His other trebles
              came in 4-0 home wins over West Brom and Stoke City, plus a 3-0 FA
              Cup victory at Fulham, while he made his Champions League debut
              against Monaco in September, 2016, and scored his first goal in
              the competition in the reverse fixture in November, 2016, before
              adding to his tally in our 3-1 home win over CSKA Moscow at
              Wembley. He earned his fourth EA SPORTS Player of the Month award
              in February, 2017, was once again named in the PFA Premier League
              Team of the Year and also picked up the PFA Fans’ Premier League
              Player of the Season prize - decided by a public vote. He hit new
              heights in terms of his goalscoring in 2017/18, reaching 30 goals
              in the Premier League and 41 in all competitions, including
              back-to-back hat-tricks at the end of 2017 against Burnley and
              Southampton to break Alan Shearer's record for the most Premier
              League goals scored in a calendar year with 39. Equalling the
              record for the most Premier League Player of the Month awards in a
              single season by claiming his fifth and sixth prizes in September
              and December, 2017, he also began to work his way up the club's
              top 10 goalscorers of all time list and on 13 January, 2018, he
              became our record Premier League goalscorer, overtaking Teddy
              Sheringham with his 98th in a 4-0 home win against Everton. He was
              also named in the PFA Premier League Team of the Year for a fourth
              year in a row. Capped earlier in his career by England at Under-17
              and 19 levels, Harry was a member of the Young Lions' squad for
              the 2013 FIFA Under-20 World Cup and played all three games in
              Turkey. In June, 2015, he was part of the England Under-21s squad
              for the European Under-21 Championship finals in the Czech
              Republic and 12 months later he played for the Three Lions' senior
              side at Euro 2016 in France. He captained his national team for
              the first time in a World Cup qualifier away to Scotland in June,
              2017, when he scored a stoppage-time equaliser in a 2-2 draw and
              was subsequently appointed England captain for the 2018 FIFA World
              Cup in Russia, where he claimed the tournament's Golden Boot with
              six goals as the Three Lions heroically reached the semi-finals
              before eventually finishing fourth.

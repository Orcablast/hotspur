              Talented young midfielder Dele Alli has been a shining light since
              emerging onto the senior stage - and continues to improve. An
              established regular for club and country, the England
              international scored in our 2-1 win at Newcastle on the opening
              day of 2018/19 and went on to clock up five goals in 25 Premier
              League appearances throughout that season. He also scored twice in
              our run to the Carabao Cup semi-finals and made 38 appearances in
              all competitions, including eight starts in our run to the
              Champions League Final against Liverpool in Madrid in June, 2019.
              The highly-rated starlet initially joined us from MK Dons in
              February, 2015, before returning there to complete the 2014/15
              League One campaign. There, he enjoyed an outstanding season with
              16 goals in 39 appearances in the third tier of English football
              as MK were promoted automatically into the Championship as
              runners-up behind Bristol City. His performances were recognised
              with a place in the PFA's League One Team of the Season and he was
              voted the Football League's Young Player of the Season. Dele made
              his Spurs debut off the bench at Manchester United on the opening
              day of the 2015/16 season and headed home his first goal for us a
              fortnight later in a 1-1 draw at Leicester City. Having played in
              a deeper midfield role, he sparkled in attack as the season
              progressed and scored Match of the Day's Goal of the Season and
              our Supporters' Clubs' Goal of the Season with a tremendous flick,
              turn and volley in a 3-1 victory at Crystal Palace in January,
              2016. He finished that campaign with a total of 10 Premier League
              goals and 46 appearances in all competitions to his name and was
              named PFA Young Player of the Year and earned a spot in the PFA
              Premier League Team of the Year. Dele subsequently enjoyed an even
              better 2016/17 campaign which saw him break the 20-goal barrier
              with 22 in total, start all six of our Champions League games, win
              his first EA SPORTS Player of the Month award in January, 2017,
              pick up a second consecutive PFA Young Player of the Year award,
              earn a place in the PFA Team of the Year for the second time and
              be named One Hotspur Junior Members' Player of the Season - again
              for the second successive season. Plus, he won our Supporters'
              Clubs' Goal of the Season prize for the second year in a row, this
              time for his cracker against Watford at White Hart Lane in April,
              2017. In all, he played 50 times for us during that season and
              memorably scored three consecutive braces against Southampton,
              Watford and Chelsea around the turn of the year - the latter
              coming in the form of two near-identical headers as we vanquished
              the league leaders at White Hart Lane. Dele scored 14 goals in 50
              appearances for us across all competitions in 2017/18, including a
              wonderful strike in our 3-1 victory at Chelsea on 1 April, where
              he pulled down a long ball with one deft touch and then slammed
              past Willy Caballero with his second to help us register our first
              win at Stamford Bridge since 1990. That was the first of two goals
              he scored in that game while he also memoraby scored a brace in
              our 3-1 home Champions League victory over eventual competition
              winners Real Madrid. In October, 2015, Dele made his senior
              England debut against Estonia in a Euro 2016 qualifier and the
              following month he rifled home a stunning long-range goal to open
              his Three Lions account in a friendly match against France at
              Wembley - beating Spurs team-mate Hugo Lloris between the sticks
              for Les Bleus. He subsequently appeared in all four of England's
              matches at Euro 2016 and was part of the Three Lions' squad that
              reached the semi-finals of the 2018 FIFA World Cup in Russia,
              scoring in a 2-0 quarter-final win over Sweden. Previously he had
              been capped by England at Under-17, Under-18, Under- 19 and
              Under-21 levels..
